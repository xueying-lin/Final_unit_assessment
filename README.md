# Final_unit_assessment

## Overview of the final project
I am in Group 9 with Mohamed, Irfan, and Kyle. We are working on a machine learning project on the topic of mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Our research question is **which group of people are affected by the pandemic mostly on their mental health (anxiety and/or depression)**

We get the data from CDC. Our dataset is the mental health portion of the household pulse survey assess the impacts of covid-19 on American households from 2020 to 2021. The data asks about the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms of each adult occurred over the last 7 days. The dataset is collected by groups which will be our factor variables. The final estimates, value is the percentage of adults who report symptoms of anxiety or depression that have been shown to be associated with diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder.

My role is to clean up the data and establish the static database for further analysis.

## Self assessment
Three out of Five. 
- During the group discussion, I am the listner and helper instead of the leader role. I hope that I can improve my group facilitating skills more in the future.
- I encouter some technical issues during the project because the nature of the original data is different from what we expect, which made it hard for me to prepare the data.
- Good thing is that I solve the issues with the help of team members, TA, and googles!
- My sickness during the project delayed my progress so I hope next time my time management skill need to be improved and the time schedule need to be more adaptive.

## Team assessment
My team is really awesome! Everyone is positive, encouraging. I thanks for my group member who can handle everything when I am in sick. 
I will give a five out of five for each of my team member.
